# BLE Chat

This project is a simple chat application that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate between devices. The app allows users to discover nearby devices and send messages to each other, as broadcast or private messages.

It uses **Google Play Services Nearby:** For discovering and connecting to nearby devices.

There is 2 main views in the app:

- **Global Chat:** Allows the user to send messages to all the connected device.

- **Private Chat:** Allows the user to send messages to a specific device. (The message is shown only to the selected device in the global chat, those messages are marked with [Private])
